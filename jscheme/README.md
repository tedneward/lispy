# jscheme

This is taken directly from [Norvig's website](https://norvig.com/jscheme.html), no copyright is asserted. I poured the source jar into a Gradle project, and haven't changed anything besides a few syntactic Java cleanup things (using the preferred form for static method invocation, for example), formatting the code a touch more consistently, and trying to sneak in a few unit tests here and there. I may/will take the liberty to bring things up to a Java21-era baseline, too.

Note that the goal here is not to produce the world's most efficient or even compliant version of Scheme, but just to have one that "mostly works" so that I have a base from which to tinker and/or springboard.

The original sources from Norvig's website are in `jscheme.jar` and stored here for historical and reference reasons.

No copyright or ownership is asserted by any of this; if you have IP-ownership concerns, consult Norvig's original website for details.
